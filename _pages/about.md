I am Dawei Yan, a final year PhD student at the School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China. My supervisors are Prof. Panlong Yang and Prof. Xiang-Yang Li (ACM/IEEE Fellow). My research interests cover wireless sensing, mobile computing, and RF fingerprints. Researchers are welcome to contact me via email, and I look forward to our collaboration to make meaningful research contributions!
